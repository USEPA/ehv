# Environmental Health Vocabulary Curation
A repository for curation and related activities of the Environmental Health Vocabulary (EHV).

This repository contains a notebook that identifies candidate EHV terms from Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative ([HAWC](https://github.com/shapiromatron/hawc)). Candidate terms are matched to EHV terms using an automated string-matching workflow. Candidate terms that are not matched can continue onto further review for incorporation into the EHV, while those that match existing EHV terms can be incorporated into the EHV as synonyms.

Found in the data directory is a copy of the EHV (ehv.xlsx) and outputs from the notebook.

This repository accommpanies the methods avaiable in the publication [Standardized Data Reporting in Human Health Chemical Assessments Using A Semi-Automated Curation Workflow for the Environmental Health Vocabulary](10.5281/zenodo.11176258).
